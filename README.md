# Predicting Used Car Prices

The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model that estimates the sale price of used cars based on different explanatory variables describing aspects of cars.

## Why is this important?

Predicting used car prices is useful in pricing auto insurance premiums and replacement costs insured cars.

## What is the objective of the machine learning model?
We aim to minimise the difference between the real price and the estimated price from the model. We will evaluate model performance with the:
1. Mean Squared Error (MSE).
2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
3. R-Squared (r2).
